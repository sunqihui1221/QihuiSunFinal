# QihuiSunFinal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of QihuiSunFinal is to check statistics of pokemons, including weigt, height and strength.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("sunqihui1221/MyPackage")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(QihuiSunFinal)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
# Function 1, Show statistics of pokemons, including weight, height and strength.
pokemon_data() 
```

```{r}
# Function 2, Show chosen statistics of pokemons, "Weight" statistics for pokemons
pokemon_data_partial("Weight")
```

```{r}
# Function3, Show summary statistics of pokemons, for example, "Weight"
summary_pokemon_data_partial("Weight", TRUE)
```
